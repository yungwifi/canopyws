# Canopy Workforce Solutions Code Challenge 
Create a Employee Search Engine and Employee List and show us what you can bring to the team!

# Lessons Learned 
The biggest lesson I "re-learned" is the importance of planning when starting a project from scratch. I was too excited and too eager to make headway 
on the challenge that I just hopped straight in and ended up getting lost in the process. Secondly I learned a whole lot about the power of ASP.NET MVC architecture. 
People can say what they want about this framework but god dammit it is powerful.

# Biggest Problems 
The biggest problem I ran into during this code challenge was probably spending all of Saturday trying to teach myself how to make the API call 
from the server and have it return data. Obviously that would have been a great achievement but it made me lose sight of the fact that I had so much more
to learn about ASP.NET and C#. I also spun my wheels for too long and should have just focused on an MVP solution for this code challenge. Secondly 
I should have planned my project better and timeboxed my tasks. I think had I been more diligent in the planning phase I wouldnt have spent and entire 
day on one problem and had the insight to move on to other tasks. 

# Known Bugs / Issues 
Currently the application is not able to access the API to pull down the data for the models of the Employees, and Pay Frequencies. This issue is more due 
to the fact that I am not very familiar with Oath and setting up permissions on a server using any framework. However I was able to get the API calls working in Postman. Secondly 
My front end needs to be styled more. I had hopes of being able to use React but I needed the extra time to learn the MVC archictecture on ASP.NET.

# Phase 2 
For Phase 2 of this code challenge I would really like to be able to get the API call working. I also would like to incude React as the front end. 
Also I would really like to be able to get to the pagination and search functionalty of the app. I think that would be a great exercises and great 
experience to add to my belt.
